# Learning SwiftUI

This repository tracks my progress learning SwiftUI through comprehensive tutorials from two primary sources:

- **Hacking with Swift - 100 Days of SwiftUI**: A structured 100-day course covering Swift fundamentals and SwiftUI development
- **Apple's Official SwiftUI Tutorials**: Apple's first-party tutorials covering essential SwiftUI concepts and framework integration

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Master Swift programming fundamentals
- Build proficiency in SwiftUI, mainly for iOS development. If something piques my interest, also watchOS and macOS development
- Create real-world applications using modern iOS development practices
- Understand framework integration and advanced UI concepts
